## 🤔 What is a Roadmap?

A roadmap in this ecosystem is a single Markdown file that provides a step-by-step guide to learning a specific topic.

A great roadmap should include:

-   ✅ **Key Concepts:** The foundational knowledge a learner needs.
-   ✅ **Curated Resources:** Links to the best articles, videos, and docs.
-   ✅ **Project Ideas:** Hands-on projects to apply the new skills.
