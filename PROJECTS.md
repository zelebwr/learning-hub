## A Tale of Two Projects

We have two primary types of projects, each identified by a prefix in its repository name:

-   **`learn-` (ðŸ§  Learning Projects):** These are our sandboxes. The main goal is the **learning process** itself. They are for trying new things, making mistakes, and documenting what we've learned in a `learning-log.md`.
-   **`folio-` (ðŸš€ Portfolio Projects):** These are projects intended to be **polished, well-documented, and shareable**. They represent our best work and are built following a detailed `PROJECT-BRIEF.md`.
