# 🌱 Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for helping us build this ecosystem! Every contribution, from a small typo fix to a new project brief, is valuable. To keep our collaboration smooth and organized, please follow these guidelines.

## 📜 **Our Core Philosophy**

> **All changes must be made through a Pull Request (PR).** Direct pushes to the `main` branch are disabled. This is the golden rule that protects our repository and ensures every change is reviewed.

## 🚀 **Your First Contribution Workflow**

Here is the step-by-step process for getting your changes merged.

1.  **🍴 Fork the Repository**

    -   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a personal copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

2.  **🌿 Create a New Branch**

    -   In _your forked repository_, create a new branch from `main`. Name it according to our **[Naming Conventions](NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md)**.

    ```bash
    # Example: git checkout -b feat/add-python-roadmap
    ```

3.  **💻 Make Your Changes**

    -   Work on your changes locally. Add, edit, or delete files as needed. Commit your work with clear messages.

4.  **✨ Write Clear Commit Messages**

    -   We use the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** standard. This makes our history readable and helps automate releases.

    ```bash
    # Example: feat(roadmaps): add initial draft for python data science
    # Example: fix(readme): correct broken link to projects file
    ```

5.  **📤 Open a Pull Request**

    -   Push your branch to your fork on GitHub. You'll then see a prompt to "Compare & pull request" on the original repository's page.
    -   Write a clear title and description for your PR, explaining _what_ you changed and _why_. If it resolves an issue, link it (e.g., "Closes #42").

6.  **👀 Participate in the Review**

    -   A teammate will review your PR. They may ask for changes. This is a normal and healthy part of the collaborative process!
    -   Address the feedback, make any necessary changes, and push them to the same branch.

7.  **🎉 Merge!**
    -   Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the `main` branch. Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution!
